/*
method decleration: 
    access-modifier specifier  returnType name(parameter){}
         public       static     void 
    return-Type: void or other data-types (int, String..)
            if the return is not void, it MUST be primitive or non primitives.
            there can only be one return-type
    if the return-type is void, the method does not return any value
    if the retun-Type is not void: the method MUST return a value

//cok onemli
return statement: it's used for exiting the method, we can also use return statement to retun a vlue from the method
continue statement: skips the current iteration of the loop
break statement: exits from  loop or switch statement
System.exit(0): java stops all the execution


return method:
            1. does not have "void" as return Type
            2. MUSt return a Value
            3. the returning value MUST macth with the return-Type of the method
            4. the method body Must be closed with return statement


optional task:
    1. write a method that accepts String array, and returns the longest String value form the array
void method VS return method:
            void methoddoesnt return any value
            return method MUST return a value
