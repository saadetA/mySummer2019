	/*Topic: Return Methods, Method Overloading, Review String methods
	Package: day29_ReturnMethods
	Warm up:
	1. write a method that can find the frequency of characters in String.
	    Ex: 
	        FrequencyTest("XXXYYYZZZ")
	        output: X3Y3Z3
	        FrequencyTest("AAABBBBBCCCC")
	        output: A3B5C4
	        THIS IS A JAVA INTERVEIW QUESTION
	 
	    
	method decleration: 
	    access-modifier specifier  returnType name(parameter){}
	         public       static     void 
	    return-Type: void or other data-types (int, String..)
	            if the return is not void, it MUST be primitive or non primitives.
	    if the return-type is void, the method does not return any value
	    if the retun-Type is not void: the method MUST return a value
	return statement: it's used for exiting the method, we can also use return statement to retun a vlue from the method
	return method:
	            1. does not have "void" as return Type
	            2. MUSt return a Value
	            3. the returning value MUST macth with the return-Type of the method
	            4. the method body Must be closed with return statement
