1 quarter = 25 cents.
1 dimes = 10 cents.
1 nickels  = 5 cents.
you will need to use assignment and short hand operators for this task. Good luck (edited)

/*Write a Java program to calculate total amount of sale based on the unit price 
 *and quantity of a product taken.   
User should be able to enter unit price and quantity.
Then the program will perform calculations and display amounts.
The discount rate is 10% for the quantity purchased between 100 and 120 units,
 and 15% for the quantity purchased greater than 120 units.
If the quantity purchased is less than 100 units, the discount rate is 0%.
See the example output as shown below:
