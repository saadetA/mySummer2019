Abstraction: concetrating on essentials/important things, not worrying about the dtails/im plementation
                hiding the implementation details
        car: 
            start(){ 
                    put the key
                    turn the engine on
                    start driving
                }
abstract method: a method without body/implementation
                    public abstract start();  ==> generic
                it's a method that's meant to be override ( cannot be final, private), in the regular sub class
                Only the instance methods can be override and can be abstract
                
                abstract method can only be declared in abstract class and interface
                    ex: 
                        Pontanic car:   
                            start(){
                                call the mechanic
                                put the key in
                                start the engine
                                jump start
                                driver
                            }
                        Tesla ca:
                            start(){
                                say "start"
                                driver
                            }
abstract class:  abstract is something not concrete
                we cannot create object from
                a class meant to be extended
                abstract class cannot be final
                if the sub class is regular class, the sub class MUST override the abstract methods
                if the sub class is asbtract, no need to override
        why we cannot create object from abstract class?
                abstraction is something not concrete, object is concrete
