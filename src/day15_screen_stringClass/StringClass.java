String class:
        
 1. String is an object
   there are two ways to create object from String class:
                                1. String literals:
                                                String str = "Cybertek";
                                2. by using "new" keyword:
                                    String str = new String("Cybertek")
                    when the String object is created by String literals, that object will be saved at String pool (String pool does not take duplicates)
                    when the String object is created by using "new" keyword. the object will be saved at java heap memory (not within the String pool)
                    heap memory : the place where all the objects are store at
                    String pool : located in heap memory, stores all string literals' objects 
                    everytime when we use new keyword, compiler will create a new object in java Heap memory
