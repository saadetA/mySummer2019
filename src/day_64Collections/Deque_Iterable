Package Name: day64_Collections
Collection (I): extended by List(I), Set(I), Queue(I)
List(I): does have index numbers, takes duplicated values
Set(I): deos not have index numbers, does not take duplicates
Queue(I): does not have index numbers, does accept duplicates
        
        implemented by PriorityQueue(C)
        extended by Deque(I)
        Deque(I) is implemented by ArrayDeque(C), LinkedList(C)
        LinkedList(C) is implementing both List(I) & Deque(I)
        sorts in ascending order when there is no duplication
        Queue(I): 
                poll(): FIFO ==> First In First Out
                    return the first object as same data type,
                    at the same time it removes the first object from the Queue
        Deque(I):
            addFirst(object): adds the given object to the starting point of the Deque
            addLast(object): adds the given object to the very end of the Deque
            removeFirst(): removes the first object from Deque
            removeLast(): removes the last object from Deque
            getfirst(): retrives the first object from the Deque
            getLast(): retrives the last object from the Deque
Iterable(I):
