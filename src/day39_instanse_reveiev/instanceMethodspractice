java Reveiw:
        1. instance variables
        2. instance methods
        3. this keywords (this. vs this())
        4. Decimal formatter class  
package: day39_JavaReview       
warmup:
    create  a custom class for CellPhones
        instance variables:  brand, Screensize, color, price
        instance methods: call, message, takePhoto
    
instance variable: created outside methods, within the class. (object)
                    it's also called fields
local variables: created within the methods. not visible to other methods
                    can only be used within the method
instance methods: methods that deos not have static specifier. but do have return type. (object)
this. : used for calling instance variables, we used when local and instance variables have the same names

this. : used for calling instance variables, we used when local and instance variables have the same names
this(): used for calling the constructors within the class
DecimalFormatter class: presented in  "java.text"
class: where the objects are came from. it's the blueprint of the object
            determines how object will behave
object: instance of the class. we can store different datas to objects
object creation:
            ClassName obj = new  ExistingConstructor;
Overload: same method name different parameter.
            return type can be same or different.
