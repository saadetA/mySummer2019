what can be static in java 4
1-static veriables
2-static methods
3-static initilizers
4-inner class(nested class)

instance veriables:created in the class and outside any methods they belongs to the objet
how many objct can you create multiple in class more as you can each object.if you create ten object you can
you can copy variables to the veriable.instance classinda bir int a;dediginde o syafada kac obje create edersen et 
a degerini int cinsinden cagirabilirsin

int a;
obj.a=10;
obj1.a=20;
obj3.a=50;istedigimiz kadar a ya deger verebiliriz
fakat local veriabllar method icinde create ediliyor.only acceble in method body loop ve method ta create ettigimiz her
veriable local veriabledir
main method ta local veriable create edersek sadece orda kullaniriz.local veriable only visible in the method

*

STATIC VERIABLES==CLASS VERIABLES(DECLARITON IS SIMILAR THE INSTANCE VERIABLES JUST DIFFERENT USING STATIC KEYBORD)
you should write with static keyboard because when  veriable is a static in shared in all class and all other objects
whe can call static veriables with class name ornek staticKeybord obj=new staticKeybord();


*instance veriables you can copy multiply times but static veriables you can copy one time
*int a;=====>instance istendigi kadar kopyalanir her a koydugunda istedigin degeri verebilirsin
*
*static b;======>olursa birkere 400 degeri verirsen her b yi cagirdiginda 400 degeri gelir

System.out.println(obj1.name);//burdada saadet verir ama enyukardaki omer kalir
//burda string degisiyor static olunca.ama final keybord olursa immtuble olur

static: means that we can access the members through the class name
        
        static members belongs to the class, also called class members
what can be static in java:
                1. static variables
                2. static methods
                3. static initializer block
                4. static inner class (nested class)
instance variables: created in the class outside any method.
        belongs to the object. each object will have its own copy
local variables: declared within the methods or blocks
                only accessible within the method or block
static variables: created in the class outside any method with static keyword
          when a variable is static, it's shared by class and all objects of the class. 
        we can call it through the class name
        
        when a variable is static, it's shared by class and all objects of the class. and we can call it through the class name
Static methods: a method that we can call through the class name
        
        static methods only accepts class members (static)
        none static can only be called through the objects in the static method

STATIC METHODS1- WE CAN CALL IT WITH CLASS NAME
2-THERE IS NO INSTANCE OBJECTS OR INSTANCE VERIABLES IN THE STATIC METHOS
3-STATIC METHODS ONLY ACCEPTS CLASS MEMBERS(STATIC VERIABLES AND OBJECTS)
4-JAVA DA CLASS ISMIYLE CAGIRDIGINIZ HERSEY STATIC TIR ARRAYS.TOSTRING MESELA

STATIC METHODS
1-ONLY ACCEPTS class members ,non static must be called through the object
2_static features are shared by class and all other objects
                can only have one copy
 3-each objects they have thier own copy of instance variables

    summary:
        1. static is shared by class and all other objects
        2. there can only be one copy for the static variable
        3. each objects has its own copy of instance variable
        4. static members can be called through the class name
        5. static methods only accepts static members
        6. in order to call none static in a static method we MUST call it though the object
    






if we call static veriables inthe same class we dont have to call with class name but if we call static members in another class we should
call it with classname
